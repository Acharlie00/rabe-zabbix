Monitoring of auto-discovered IPMI drive slot sensors (sensor type code `0Dh`).

An external script is used for low-level discovery of the sensors (as Zabbix currently lacks LLD of IPMI sensors).

## Usage
1. Install the [IPMI sensor discovery script](../Sensor_Discovery).
2. Import the [`Template_IPMI_Drive
   Slot_Sensors.xml`](Template_IPMI_Drive_Slot_Sensors.xml) into your Zabbix
   server.
3. Add the template to your host (or stack template)
4. Set the following user macros on your host or template (those are required
   for the auto discovery to work)
   * `{$HOST.IPMI.CONN}` IP address or domain name of your IPMI host
   * `{$HOST.IPMI.USER}` IPMI user
   * `{$HOST.IPMI.PASS}` IPMI password
5. Add an IPMI interface to your host
6. Configure the IPMI parameters of your host
7. Check if new data arrives
